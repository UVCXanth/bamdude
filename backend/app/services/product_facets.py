"""A product's stored plate facets — material, colour, printer model — ONE writer
(spec workshop-product-catalog, rules 3–7).

The catalog filters and searches by them in SQL, so they are stored rather than
parsed out of every linked file's JSON on each request (owner, 2026-09-26). The
plates they come from have one writer too (``product_sync``), and every rewrite
of a file's metadata (re-scan, a MakerWorld re-download, the objects backfill)
ends in that sync, so refreshing here whenever ``product_sync`` reconciles a
file keeps them true.

A row names the FILE it came from. The catalog reads only the rows of files
outside the trash (``visible_facet``; owner, 2026-09-27) — what the product's
plate list shows — so trashing and restoring, which do not pass through the
sync, need nothing from here.

Rows are replaced with Core statements, never ORM objects: a reader in the same
session may hold the old rows in its identity map, and a new object with the
same primary key would collide with them at flush. Id lists go to the database
in chunks of ``SQL_CHUNK`` — a whole catalog in one IN would pass asyncpg's
bind-parameter limit.
