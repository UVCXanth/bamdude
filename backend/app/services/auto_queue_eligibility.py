"""Eligibility evaluation for auto-queue items.

Given an AutoQueueItem and a set of printers already busy in the
current scheduler tick, pick the printer whose queue the item should join:

1. Matches ``target_model`` (case-insensitive, normalised).
2. Matches ``target_location`` if specified.
3. Has ``auto_distribute_eligible=True`` on its PrinterQueue.
4. Is connected over MQTT.
5. Can feed every used channel of the plate: the routing plan is resolved
   against the printer's feed under the item's own policy
   (``resolve_filament_routing``), so what counts as a match — base
   material or the exact profile, exact colour or not — is the question the
   item was queued with, and the same one dispatch asks again.
6. Satisfies ``filament_overrides``: when an override has
   ``force_color_match=True``, the printer must have an exact type+color
   match in some loaded slot — and the same ``tray_info_idx`` when both
   sides carry one, so PLA Basic/Matte/Silk are not interchangeable.
   Without the flag, color matches are counted as a preference and the
   highest-scoring printer wins.

**Routing is not dispatching, and readiness is not a filter here.** Whether a
printer can start *right now* — plate-clear gate, drying, staggering, the lot —
is decided by ``print_scheduler.check_queue`` at dispatch, from the DB claim on
``PrinterQueue.status`` and the live printer state. Asking the same question a
second time at routing time does not make anything safer: an item placed in a
blocked printer's queue simply waits there, visibly, until that printer is
ready. What it *did* do was refuse to place anything at all, which is how an
operator ended up with three idle machines, an auto-queue reporting
"Busy: A1M-TR, A1M-TL, A1M-BL", and no Clear Plate prompt anywhere — that
prompt renders off the printer's own queue, which auto-queue was declining to
fill. Readiness now only ranks candidates (see the sort in
``find_eligible_printer``); a ready printer wins, a busy one still gets work.

This diverges from upstream ``PrintScheduler._find_idle_printer_for_model``,
which has one flat queue and therefore no "place it and let the owner decide"
option. PrinterQueue also carries the ``auto_distribute_eligible`` opt-out flag.

Returns a tuple ``(printer, waiting_reason)``:
- ``(Printer, None)`` if eligible
- ``(None, reason_string)`` describing why no printer is available

    """The printers the router may not place on this tick.

    A printer is off-limits when EITHER its queue is printing OR its queue
    already holds a pending item, however that item got there — manual queue,
    scheduled, a prior auto-route. The ``status='printing'`` clause alone is not
    enough: between auto-queue tick N (which assigns items 1..K to K printers as
    pending rows) and the per-printer scheduler's next tick (which flips
    ``PrinterQueue.status`` as its synchronous prep walks the items in queue_id
    order) there is a window where some printers have flipped and the lagging
    ones have not. A tick that fires inside it sees the laggards as free and
    double-stacks the next items onto them — every new auto item landing on the
    same lagging printer. "Has any pending row" closes the gap: each tick places
    at most one new item per printer, and the next placement waits until the
    queue actually drains.

    One function, so the rebalancer (``services/queue_rebalance.py``) reads the
