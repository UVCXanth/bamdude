"""Archive → order-line attribution and every order figure (spec §Fact attribution).

The archive is the only source of fact. Queue tables are never read here.
Everything is computed on read over one loaded ``OrderContext``; an order has
tens to hundreds of archives, which is nothing.

That last sentence is about ONE order. The list pages ask about many at once
(``batch_contexts`` → :func:`grouped_figures`), where "tens to hundreds of
archives" is multiplied by the page — which is why that loader is batched
rather than looped, why its ``IN`` lists are chunked, and why its parity with
