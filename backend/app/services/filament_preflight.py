    auto-queue's placement check and the latch key; the dispatch guard asks
    ``plan_holds`` instead.

    ``PrinterFeedSnapshot.revision`` hashes a tray's ``tray_info_idx`` with
    everything else, so re-tagging a spool in the AMS moves the marker of every
    printer that holds it. That is the right answer for a job that asked for one
    exact profile and the wrong one for a job that said «any ABS will do»: with
    «allow base material match» on, no profile id takes part in routing, so a job
    prepared minutes ago was stopped — or kept stopped — by a fact its own plan
    had already been told to ignore.

    With the option OFF this IS the snapshot's own marker, unchanged, which is
    also why a block recorded by an older build still matches for such a job.
    With it ON the same facts are re-hashed without ``variant``. Everything
    physical survives verbatim: each source's tag (``tray_uuid``/``tag_uid``),
    material, colour, nozzle binding, feed kind and slot id, plus the connection
    generation and the shape of the feed itself. A swapped spool, a re-coloured
    one, a lost AMS or a reconnect all still move this. With it ON,
    ``declared_variant`` is left out beside ``variant``: re-advertising a Generic
    family moves no filament either.

    The one fact of ``snapshot_from_state``'s own payload that cannot travel here
    is which sources an advertised-profile overlay masked: it is folded into the
    revision but not exposed on the snapshot. An overlay whose actual values
    equal the live ones is therefore invisible to this signature — and to the
    resolver too, which sees identical ``FeedSource`` rows either way.

    ⚠️ In the other direction, ``backup_enabled`` makes the ON signature STRICTER
    than the raw marker on that one axis: the revision does not hash it, this
    does. So the first status push that fills it in between preflight and publish
    defers an ON job once, on a fact that changed nothing about the trays. The
    next preflight re-reads it and the job goes — accepted rather than papered
    over, because a feed whose backup state we have only just learned is a feed
    we were routing against half-known.
