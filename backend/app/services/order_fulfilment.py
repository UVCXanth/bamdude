"""An order's goods assembled, received and issued in batches — one function reads, one performs
(spec workshop-order-issue, rules 11, 12, 24).

:func:`state` is what the issue window shows and what :func:`apply` checks against: the same
arithmetic for the display and for the act. ``apply`` reads it again under the locks, refuses any
number above it with a sentence (409 — never clamped: an issue is physical units handed over) and
writes nothing then; otherwise, per line, assemble → receive → write off → issue, one :class:`StockIssue` for
the whole request, the journal, and — asked and allowed — the order closed. It writes through the
ledgers' own writers only (``finished_stock``, ``part_stock``, ``stock_issues``) and never commits.
