"""Issues of goods — the ONE writer of ``stock_issues`` (spec workshop-order-issue, rule 10).

An issue is one «Виконати» of an order's «Склад і видача» that hands units over,
or a manual issue off the stock page. It is written with a SNAPSHOT — the
customer's name, the recipient, the delivery — because the contact and the
delivery directory may change or go; afterwards only the waybill number and the
note may change. What it handed over are the issue movements of both ledgers that
name it — and, once sealed, the lines of its dispatch note, which is what is shown.
Since WS-12 the issue IS the dispatch note ``DN-<id>``: :func:`seal` writes its snapshot
(lines, supplier, basis, performer, units) once, in the issuing transaction, after the
movements (spec workshop-dispatch-notes).
``tests/unit/test_stock_issues_have_one_writer.py`` keeps every other module out.

Never commits. Refusals are :class:`StockIssueError` — an English sentence the
route forwards verbatim (translated at the boundary) with its HTTP status.
