        no task was cancelled. ``order`` lets a requeued low keep its first admission order.

        ``on_admit`` runs once, synchronously, when the slot is granted; the absolute monotonic-ns deadline it
        returns bounds this attempt (a job's budgets run from its first admission). ``on_hand_off`` runs once,
        synchronously, at the hand-off of an ok result — the point of no return, under the arbiter's gate.

        ``publication`` (spec §5): a gate whose ``acquire()`` is asked in that same synchronous step, before the
        hand-off — a closed gate (restore) revokes the result, so nothing reaches its attach; the lease is held
        through the caller's publication and released when this context exits, and ``result.publishable`` says it
        was taken. Nothing waits for a pause inside the slot (Codex A-r3): a paused gate (a backup copying the
        pictures) DEFERS the attempt — at entry before anything is read, at the hand-off through the ordinary proof
        of end — and its owner retries after the pause. ``publication_optional`` (slicing, whose own output needs no
        publication right): a paused or closed gate hands the result off WITHOUT a lease — usable, not publishable."""
