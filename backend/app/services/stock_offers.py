"""«Взяти зі складу» — ready units and kits for what an order has not printed, is not
printing and has not queued (spec workshop-order-issue, rule 17).

The offer is the plan's own arithmetic — ``plan_engine.unplanned_units`` over the figures
and the queue reading the plan endpoint uses — handed to ``stock_pick.suggest``, the one
function that answers what the shelves give; asked WITHOUT a line id, because an offer
ADDS to the line and the units it already holds are not free for it. Taking goes through
the two add-only doors (``finished_stock.take_for_line``, ``part_stock.add_kits_for_line``)
— never a release first, whatever the line has moved — and what it gets may be less than
what was shown: the shelf is clamped, never refused (a reservation, as in WS-10).
