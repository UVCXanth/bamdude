"""How far one dispatch attempt got, on its execution archive (post-rebuild D-R3, m207).

The RAM half of the fact is ``PrintDispatchJob.send_fact`` — refused / sent / accepted,
set right where the runner learns it. This module is its durable half and the ONE
writer of ``print_archives.dispatch_phase`` / ``dispatch_boot_id``:

* ``prepared`` — stamped on the execution archive in the transaction that inserts it,
  with the boot of the process that owns the attempt;
* ``sending`` — committed by the runner's own session immediately before the start
  command; a commit that fails or a compare-and-set that loses forbids the send;
* ``sent`` — after the command was queued for publish;
* ``accepted`` — after the printer was seen running it, never on an acknowledgement
  alone.

Every transition is a compare-and-set on this attempt's archive: still ``printing``,
still the phase it comes from, still the boot that wrote it. Nothing moves a phase
back, and nothing writes over a terminal row. A refusal is not a phase: the
``sending`` row of a refused start is closed by its owner, not rolled back to
``prepared``. NULL is unknown, and is never inferred from a name or an age.
