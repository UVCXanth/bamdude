"""One road for every new order line (spec workshop-add-to-order, rules 6–7, 11–12).

The add-to-order dialog's batch (``POST /projects/{id}/lines/batch``), the old
single-line route and an order created with its lines all come through
:func:`add_lines`, so a line is born the same way whatever door it came in by:
its row, its configuration (``line_config.seed_line``), its stock and its
journal entry, in the caller's transaction.

Stock is taken only by an ACTIVE order, and only by a product line: ready units
of the line's configuration first (``finished_stock.reserve_for_line``), kits of
free parts for the rest (``part_stock.reserve_for_line``). ``stock: "auto"``
asks :func:`stock_pick.suggest`; explicit numbers are taken as far as the shelf
goes — the writers CLAMP, never refuse, so a shelf that moved while the dialog
was open gives less and the answer says how much (``asked`` / ``got``).

A refusal of any line raises :class:`LineIntakeError` with that line's own
sentence; the route turns it into the HTTP answer and the request's transaction
rolls back — a batch is added whole or not at all.
