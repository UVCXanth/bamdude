    """The archive that still has something to show for a file on the card — or None.

    One owner for "printer file name → archive" (spec 2026-09-12 §3.1): the
    file manager asks here, and the printer-card cover asks here only as its
    fallback — first it takes the running print's own archive by id
    (``routes/printers.resolve_current_archive_id``), because a name is how to
    find an archive when nobody knows which one it is. An archive's
    ``filename`` IS the card name for an external print (the download attaches
    the name it found) and DERIVES the card name for a dispatched one
    (``derive_remote_filename``: suffixes collapsed, spaces → underscores), so
    the match folds spaces on both sides and accepts ``{stem}.3mf`` /
    ``{stem}.gcode.3mf`` / the raw name / ``print_name == stem``. No content
    hash: that would need the bytes, and not fetching them is the point.

    A candidate counts when it still has **something on disk to show** — its
    3MF, or failing that its extracted ``thumbnail_path``. Two kinds of row have
    no 3MF and they are not the same thing:

    * *pending* — the row is created at print start with ``file_path=""`` and no
      thumbnail yet, while the 3MF is still being fetched. It has nothing to
      show and must never shadow an older populated row; having neither a path
      nor a thumbnail, it is already excluded in SQL.
    * *cleaned* — retention (``archive_cleanup_service``) deleted the 3MF and
      blanked ``file_path`` but deliberately KEPT ``thumbnail_path``, because
      the row is print history. Amended 2026-09-12: that surviving picture is a
      valid answer and gets used.

    A **trashed** row (``deleted_at`` set) never answers either, newest or not:
    it falls through to the next candidate exactly as a vanished file does.
    ``PrintArchive.active()`` is the rule — trash must not leak into a normal
    flow — and the sibling URL the plates route hands out
    (``/archives/{id}/plate-thumbnail/{n}``) refuses a trashed row anyway.

    Newest ``created_at`` first, and a row whose files have since vanished
    yields to the next — so the walk reads light ``(id, file_path,
    thumbnail_path)`` tuples and loads only the winner as an entity. No blind
    ``LIMIT``: the eleventh row can be the only one still on disk.

    Deliberately no status filter: the printer can be FINISH (the archive
    already flipped to ``completed``) while the UI still asks for the picture.

    **Callers decide what they can serve from the answer.** The cover serves
    ``thumbnail_path`` when the row has one and opens the 3MF otherwise; the
    plates route serves the cached ``extra_data["plates"]`` plus the printed
    plate's PNG, and falls through to one read from the printer when a cleaned
    row has no cached plates either.

    ⚠️ Known hole, recorded rather than fixed: a #1542 doubled-suffix filename
    (``Model.gcode.3mf.gcode.3mf`` stored on the row) matches no arm — the stem
    of the card name is ``Model``, and folding spaces does not collapse the
    extra suffix. The download stopped producing such names (2026-09-30,
    ``archive_download.build_filename_candidates``); rows stored before keep
    them, and a library file made from such a row carries them into every
    archive dispatched from it. The consequence is graceful: the plates route
    reads the file once, as it does for a file that never printed, and the
    cover of a running print no longer depends on this match.

    even on prints that started from the printer (where BamDude's initial
    FTP fetch may have failed and only succeeded on a later retry).

    State is reset unconditionally as soon as the function is called for a
    given archive — we're declaring "this is the current print on

    corrupt 3MF, or a non-3MF archive), the state stays empty — the
    skip-objects button stays hidden, which is the truthful UI for "we
    don't know the object list for this print".

    ``is_retrigger=True`` says "this is the print already in state, told to me

    means do nothing at all, rather than reset: there is no previous print's
    data to protect against, and the reset would throw away the current
