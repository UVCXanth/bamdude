"""A source's declaration of its own baked swap sequence (swap-source-lifecycle spec r4 §2-§4, §8).

``swap_compatible`` is what the SOURCE declares: that its bytes already carry a plate-swap sequence. It is not an
analysis of the G-code and not a bed sensor. The fact has three states that must survive the whole path -- capture,
queue, execution archive, reprint, backup: True, False and unknown (``None``). False is as authoritative as True;
unknown is not False.

One place answers each question:

- :func:`classify_external_name` -- the only filename rule, applied once, when NEW external bytes arrive (upload,
  ZIP member, scan, virtual printer, an observed external start). Never to an already known source: a display
  rename changes nothing.
- :func:`archive_fact` / :func:`write_archive_fact` -- the archive's record, ``extra_data["swap_source"]``, with the
  bool column kept as its projection (``column == (value is True)``). The column is for display and for legacy
  readers only; no macro or plate-clear gate may read it directly.
- :func:`library_fact` -- a library row's declaration counts only with a valid content hash.
- :class:`SourceFact` -- a JOB's own declaration: taken at capture (:func:`archive_source` / :func:`library_source`),
  confirmed against the hash the worker computed (:func:`confirm`), kept in the job's ``source_snapshot``
  (:func:`snapshot_fact`, :func:`snapshot_with_fact`), and for a snapshot that predates the fix answered once from
  the job's own links (:func:`resolve_legacy`).
- :func:`decide` -- whether OUR swap macros may run for a job, and what an unknown source does to a request for them.
