"""What an order line would take from stock — ONE function (spec workshop-add-to-order, rule 5).

Ready units of the line's own configuration first (its finished-goods position),
then whole kits of free parts for that configuration, up to the quantity; the
rest is printed. The add-to-order dialog's proposal (``POST /stock/suggest``),
the batch's ``stock: "auto"`` and the order card's «take from stock» (WS-11)
all ask this function, so the three cannot disagree about what the shelf holds.

Read-only, and a fixed number of statements whatever the length of the list:
the products with their parts and groups in one read, the positions of every
(product, configuration) in one, the free-parts balances of every product in
one. A request naming an existing ``line_id`` also counts what that line already
holds as free for it — the line may keep its own reservation when it is
rewritten (the writers release before they take) — and what it already issued
(a reactivated order's line counts its shipped units as its own); the named
lines are read together, a fixed handful of statements for any number of them.
