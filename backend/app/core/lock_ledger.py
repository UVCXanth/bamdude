"""What the current transaction holds locked (WS-13 E1, spec BL0 / BL2).

Deadlock freedom rests on one rule: a door that WAITS on row locks takes them in
one order of classes (below) and never a lower class after a higher one. To keep
that rule a door must know what its own transaction already holds — a position
the issue dialog locked for every line is not locked again after a line, and a
position that appeared since is a refusal, not a late lock (spec BL6).

The ledger belongs to the session's OUTER transaction, not to the session and not
to single commit/rollback events: SQLAlchemy fires ``after_commit`` and
``after_rollback`` for a SAVEPOINT too. Rules (spec BL2, (1)–(4)):

1. the outer transaction ending — commit or rollback — drops the ledger whole;
   the session's next transaction starts empty;
2. a SAVEPOINT beginning snapshots the ledger;
3. a SAVEPOINT released keeps everything, before and inside it;
4. a SAVEPOINT rolled back restores the snapshot: PostgreSQL released the locks
   taken inside it, the ones taken before it stay held.

Event order the listeners rely on (measured on SQLAlchemy 2.0): a released
savepoint fires ``after_transaction_end``; a rolled-back one fires
``after_transaction_end`` and THEN ``after_soft_rollback`` naming it.
