"""The order's print plan names a library file only as far as the library shows it (WS-13 E1 LV5).

``GET /projects/{id}/plan`` is open to ``projects:read``, and each row and each
alternative plate carries the name of the file it prints. Before LV5 that name
went to every reader, so a caller the library would refuse learned a file's name
from an order it may read. The rule is the library's own (``library_name_scope``
+ ``file_name_visible``): ``library:read_all`` sees every file, ``library:read_own``
its own only (an ownerless file fails closed), anybody else none; an API key sees
them all only if its scope AND its owner pass ``library:read_all``. A hidden file
is ``filename: null, hidden: true`` — on the row and on each alternative — and
nothing else in the plan moves: the engine does not know who is reading.
