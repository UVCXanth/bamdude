"""The printer card's cover is the picture of the print running now.

The cover used to find its archive by the file name the printer echoes, and
only by that. A print dispatched from the library carries the library's name
into its archive, and the printer echoes the name it was uploaded under — when
the two did not fold into each other (a #1542 doubled suffix did exactly
that), the running print's own archive, picture and all, was never asked, and
the card and the queue's "now printing" block showed an empty frame.
