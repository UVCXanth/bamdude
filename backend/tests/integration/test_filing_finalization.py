"""A link that was allowed is data from then on (WS-13 E13 O11, Q-08).

The right to file work under an order is asked when the link is made. Revoking the right,
deactivating the person who made it or deleting them does not unlink the work: a print under
way would otherwise finish without being counted. Deleting a user forgets them as the creator
in BOTH queues — on SQLite nothing else does, and a later user given the same id would inherit
somebody else's rows.
